# Open Items
## Open Items (not blockers — tracked in findings log)

- ~15 cluster-B rows' exact fixup positions; 14 fixup *types* exist — +L only proven
  for the dominant far-pointer type (findings 20/21); exotic before-words (0xC08E…).
- 10 unresolvable overlay thunk entries (their target bytes aren't code where mapped).
- Overlay byte content for 2 skipped rows (zero-span placeholders, finding 19).
- EMS/XMS runtime memory views not representable in the static IDB.
- Batch portcheck driver + per-routine asm transcripts (Track C) not built yet.
- **Compression of the 1.2 MB tail UNKNOWN** — no `PK\x03\x04` anywhere; only DCL
  copyright strings; per-asset framing never mapped; never decompressed anything
  (findings 04 vs 31). Decide format empirically via `blast` carving + runtime dumps.
- Provenance of `./memdump/*.BIN` (Feb 2026, tool unknown) — must be re-established
  or replaced by dumps from the instrumented dosbox-staging build.
