# Falcon3 Decompilation Status — handover document

**Last updated**: 2026-10-14 (session 16 — see Time Log; always bump + append row)
**Branch**: master (HEAD `6fb6902` at time of writing)
**Snapshot**: `analysis/ida_falconcd/FALCONCD.EXE.i64` (IDA Pro 9.1, headless only)
**IDA install**: `C:\Program Files\IDA Professional 9.1\` (idat.exe at
  `C:\Program Files\IDA Professional 9.1\idat.exe`; interactive IDA must NEVER open
  Falcon — it holds the Gunship DB)

> This file is the **entry point for a future agent**. It states the exact current
> state and the exact method. Deep rationale lives in `docs/findings_log.md`
> (append-only history, findings 1–34), detailed procedures in `docs/pipeline.md`.
> Protocol: **Knowledge Capture** — 7 sinks, findings log append-only, status
> Time Log bumped on every change.

## Immediate Next Steps (in order)

1. ~~**Patch static thunk table in IDA**~~ ✅ DONE (session 17): `tools/patch_thunks_ida.py` ran headless. Thunk table at IDA EA **0x2BD9D** (not 0x1EBAF). 299/303 thunks patched — E8 trap at +0..+2 replaced with NOPs so IDA flows into JMP FAR at +3. Segments converted (JSON seg + 0x0E5E = IDA seg). 4 ambiguous (dup offset 0x000A in recs 1/53) skipped — segments already correct. Log: `analysis/ida_falconcd/patch_thunks.log`.

2. **Fresh traced run** (populate SEG_HEAP_ALLOC): Run `tools/run_falcon_traced.ps1` with `FALCON_TRACE` env. The AH=48h/49h hooks will populate `SEG_HEAP_ALLOC` with call-site attribution.

3. **Memory-deref + indirect-target hooks** (advice.md §3.3 hooks 2-3): Implement memory-deref (`LES`, `LDS`, `MOV ES:[BX]`) and indirect `CALL/JMP [BX]` logging in `falcon_trace`. Currently unimplemented.

4. **Re-check port-queue C candidates** against new boundaries (post boundary repair). The 87 UNKNOWN candidates include many dispatch-table labels (same call counts) — not functions. Documented, not pursued.
